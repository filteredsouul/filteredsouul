# About Me

I‚Äôm a recent graduate from the Master's program in Economic Analysis & Policy (Data Science & Econometrics track) at the University of Lyon 2, where I specialized in public policy evaluation, causal inference, and applied statistics.

I completed a 5-month internship at INRAE as a research economist, working on the evaluation of free public transportation using panel data models and quasi-experimental methods (STATA, R, QGIS). I then transitioned to a 6-month internship at HelloFresh, joining the Customer Care Analytics team. There, I built SQL/Python tools for decision-making, designed dashboards, and led several impact analyses on operational performance and customer satisfaction.

I‚Äôm now actively looking for my first full-time opportunity as a Data Analyst, ideally at the intersection of product, operations, and strategy. In the meantime, I‚Äôm using this GitHub to show what I can do, explore new tools, and keep sharpening my skills.

Currently improving my expertise in: exploratory data analysis, machine learning, API workflows, Streamlit dashboard design, and SQL optimization.

Open to collaborations, feedback, or discussions ‚Äî feel free to reach out on LinkedIn.
